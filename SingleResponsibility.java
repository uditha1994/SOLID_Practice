//Single Responsibility
/* A class / module should do onething and therefore it should
 * have only a single reason to change
 * 
 * Only one potential change (database logic, logging logic, etc.) 
 * in the softwareâ€™s specification should be able to affect the specification 
 * of the class.
 * 
 * This means that if a class is a data container, like a Book class or 
 * a Student class, and it has some fields regarding that entity, it should 
 * change only when we change the data model
